# __Sauna project- the first portfolio project__

This is my first landing page, which will be used as commercial one.  Mostly, my main point was to focus on my modern CSS skills - Flexbox and SCSS. Before I started leraning JS I used JQuery library to give a simple funcionality for this website, but I'm going to improve it and give it more JS 'effects', movements.

I am aware of I'm at the beginning of my programming trip. However I'm really determined to study lots of new stuff to be the best in this profession.

Currently, I'm looking for my first job, intern to still improving my skills. I'm living in Rzesz√≥w but there is no problem for relocation.
